# Frontend Take Home Assignment

This is a take home assignment for a front-end developer applying for any position at IDFlo

# Introduction

For this assignment, you will need to create a React application to implement the following Figma prototype in code. [Here](https://www.figma.com/file/vMUkje6TQHZ1RdMNrQCHj3/Take-Home-Assignment?node-id=0%3A1) is the Figma prototype.

There are four screens that need to be implemented. The data for all the screens can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/redixhumayun/117f7f2c9b132e632a50ed5a323f9c1e).

You are free to use any kind of dummy data you want to implement the screens. You are free to use any library you want while implementing the visualizations and the calendar date picker.

You will be judged on the following criteria:

1. Your ability to recreate the Figma prototype with associated functionality and color scheme
2. Your ability to architect your code in a way that is scalable. This especially applies to CSS.
3. The readability of your code. You can choose to emphasize the readability either through code style or documentation.

To do the assignment, you can fork this repo and then submit a PR back to this repository.
